This repository houses a complete AI-powered agricultural decision support system designed to empower farmers with data-driven insights. The platform integrates:

 Crop Recommendation (Classification)
Suggests the best-suited crop based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, rainfall, temperature, and humidity.

 Crop Yield Prediction (Regression)
Accurately forecasts expected crop yield using historical data and climate conditions, helping farmers plan ahead.

 Fertilizer Recommendation (Rule-Based + ML)
Provides tailored fertilizer suggestions aligned with soil tests, crop needs, and FAO guidelines.

 Key Features:

Fully trained ML models (Random Forest-based) with high accuracy.

Interactive visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots, feature importance charts).

Confusion Matrix & Evaluation reports for performance clarity.

Data sources: Kaggle Datasets + FAO & ICAR agronomic guidelines.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

 Impact:

This system helps farmers make smarter crop choices, optimize fertilizer use, and plan yield expectations, driving sustainability and profitability in agriculture.
