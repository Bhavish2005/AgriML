# AgriML
This repository houses a complete AI-powered agricultural decision support system designed to empower farmers with data-driven insights. The platform integrates:

✅ Crop Recommendation (Classification)
Suggests the best-suited crop based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, rainfall, temperature, and humidity.

✅ Crop Yield Prediction (Regression)
Accurately forecasts expected crop yield using historical data and climate conditions, helping farmers plan ahead.

✅ Fertilizer Recommendation (Rule-Based + ML)
Provides tailored fertilizer suggestions aligned with soil tests, crop needs, and FAO guidelines.

🔍 Key Features:

Fully trained ML models (Random Forest-based) with high accuracy.

Interactive visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots, feature importance charts).

Confusion Matrix & Evaluation reports for performance clarity.

Data sources: Kaggle Datasets + FAO & ICAR agronomic guidelines.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

🚜 Impact:

This system helps farmers make smarter crop choices, optimize fertilizer use, and plan yield expectations, driving sustainability and profitability in agriculture.
